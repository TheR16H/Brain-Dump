# Brain Dump

## Description
The purpose of this simple Kanban board titled [Brain Dump](https://ther16h.github.io/Brain-Dump/) is to so you can type out your objectives / things you need to do in the coming days! 
- by default each task will appear white.
- If the deadline is within 2-3 the task will appear yellow. 
- if the deadline is today (or has passed) the task will appear red so it's easy to differentiate.
